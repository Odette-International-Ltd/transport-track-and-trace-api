  title: API for Transport Track and Trace in the Automotive Industry
  description: |
    openAPI configuration file for Transport T&T processes in the automotive industry.
    ---
    This is the technical deliverable according to VDA recommendation 4998 Part 2, (Odette OA02).   
    It provides a framework for interoperable implementations throughout the automotive industry and its partners in the transport and IT area.
    For further details, please refer to the above mentioned documents.
    
    The information objects defined here provide harmonised data structures. 
    They do not, however, provide specific information on mandatory content depending on object type and process context.
    For this information, API service providers should add additional information on validation rules applied to the objects used in the supported operations.   
    This validation can be done in several ways, of course. However, a very simple and straightforward way would be to use semantic validation through schematron techniques on the data received. The output of this validation process can be used as error description in the response, should the validation fail.
    
    A compliant implementation must support:    
    /consignments [GET]    
    /consignments/{ident} [PUT, PATCH, GET]   
    /consignment-items [GET]   
    /consignment-items/{ident} [PUT, PATCH, GET]   
    /transport-events [POST, GET]    
    /transport-events/{ident} [PUT, GET]   
        
    It may further support:   
    /consignments [POST]   
    /consignment-items [POST]     
    /transport-capacity-reservations [POST, GET]      
    /transport-capacity-reservations/{ident} [PUT, PATCH, GET]   
    /transport-equipments [GET]    
    /transport-equipments/{ident} [GET]   
    /transport-means  [GET]   
    /transport-means/{ident} [GET]  
    /transport-movements  [GET]   
    /transport-movements/{ident} [GET]   
    /exchanged-messages [GET]
    /exchanged-messages/{ident} [POST]
    /exchanged-messages/{ident} [GET]
       
    Service providers may, of course, also implement operations still marked as not-implemented (except DELETE operations), as this specification is intended to support a MVP for the moment.

        Cerates a new consignment object in the system and post all data related to the consignment.
        The client must ensure that the consignment ID (primary key) is globally unique.   
        This can be achieved for instand by using a combimation of a data identifier, issuing agency code (IAC, e.g. OD for ODETTE or UN for D.U.N.S), company identification number CIN issued by aformentioned ageny and a shipment number unique within the boudaries of the identified company.

        Optional - Gets a list of messages still in the system.
        In a HUB and SPOKE system usually the HUB delivers the messages immediately and deletes them from internal storage. However, since the service consumer might not be online all the time, it is advisable to use a message broker system to temprarily store undelivered messages until the client is online again. The client then can use the GET command to retrieve the list of waiting messages and pull them one by one afterwards.
