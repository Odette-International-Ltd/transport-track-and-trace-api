  title: Transport Track and Trace API V1.1
  description: |
    openAPI configuration file for Transport T&T (T3) processes version 1.1 in the automotive industry.
    ---
    This is the technical deliverable according to Odette recommendation OA02 (also published as VDA 4998 Part 2).   
    It provides a framework for interoperable implementations throughout the automotive industry and its partners in the transport and IT area.
    For further details, please refer to the above mentioned documents.

    The information objects defined here provide harmonised data structures. 
    They do not, however, provide specific information on mandatory content depending on object type and process context.
    For this information, API service providers should add additional information on validation rules applied to the objects used in the supported operations.   
    This validation can be done in several ways, of course. However, a very simple and straightforward way would be to use semantic validation through schematron techniques on the data received. The output of this validation process can be used as error description in the response, should the validation fail.

    A compliant implementation must support:    
    /consignments [GET]    
    /transport-events [POST, GET]    
    /transport-events/{id} [GET]   
       
    Service providers may, of course, also implement operations still marked as not-implemented (except DELETE operations), as this specification is intended to support a MVP for the moment.
